Meeting of Koshetz and the department of music, including Pryh. They start discussing the organizational matters of the newly-created choir. Koshetz suggests a list of singers, all of whom are well-respected professionals. They begin a fierce discussion with Pryh, who is an active member of the socialist party and who pushes for a more democratic approach, blaming Koshetz for being too elitist. The discussion goes on for a while and, supported by the majority, Pryh wins. The committee decides to hold open auditions. As Pryh dictates the message to be sent out to the newspapers, we see the locals reading the announcement in newspapers and on the streets and gathering for the casting.
