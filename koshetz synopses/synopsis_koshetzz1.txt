The story begins in 1919, as Ukrainian choir led by Alexander Koshetz sets out on a tour across Europe. The purpose of the tour is to promote the culture and gain political support for the newly found state of Ukraine. The choir is very successful, but Ukraine ceases to exist as a country. Koshetz is a very politically aware and involved person, and he starts a cultural crusade for the sake of his country’s independence. The journey shows him that the nation lives not through its physical borders, but through the people, that carry the culture. He realizes that he needs to do what he does best and return to his craft. While Koshetz is always doing what’s “right” for the country (even if it involves self-sacrifice), Pryhodko is doing what’s right for him. Pryhodko is another main character in the story, and he is Koshetz’s opposite. Pryhodko eventually betrays Koshetz and the country. This leads to the final climax of the story, in which Koshetz must choose between his love for the country and his own self-interest.
