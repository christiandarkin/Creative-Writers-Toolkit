The story begins in 1919, with Ukrainian choirleader Alexander Koshetz and his choir setting out on a tour to promote Ukrainian culture and gain political support for the new state of Ukraine. Despite their great success, their country ceases to exist. Koshetz becomes politically aware and involved, and starts a cultural crusade for Ukrainian independence. Koshetz journey shows him that a nation lives not through its physical borders, but through its people and culture. He learns that he needs to do what is best for his country's people, and not what is best for the country itself. This ultimately leads him to self-sacrifice. Pryhodko, on the other hand, is doing what is right for himself. He is interested in power and control, and does not care about the people or the culture. This ultimately leads to his downfall. The story climaxes with Koshetz realizing that Pryhodko's power-hungry ways will only lead to disaster, and sacrificing himself to prevent this from happening.
