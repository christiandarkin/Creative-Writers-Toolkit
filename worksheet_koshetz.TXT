In 1919, Ukrainian choir, led by Alexander Koshetz, sets out on a tour across Europe in order to promote the culture and gain political support for the newly found state - Ukraine. Despite achieving tremendous success, the country they represent ceases to exist.Culture prevails above politics.
In a time, when many sacrifice their lives for the sake of a country, out main protagonist will need to learn that a true nation lives through its people and their culture and not though its political borders.
Being extremely politically aware and involved in the country’s politics, he starts a cultural crusade for the sake of his country’s independence. The journey shows him that the nation lives not through its physical borders, but through the people, that carry the culture, therefore he needs to do what he does best and return to his craft.
While Koshetz is always doing what’s “right” for the country (even if it involves self-sacrifice), Pryhodko is doing what’s right for him.
